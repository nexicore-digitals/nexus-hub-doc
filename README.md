**Nexus Hub Doc** is the living documentation surface for the Nexus ecosystem‚Äîcovering governance, Echo logic, alliance mechanics, plugin attribution, duel protocols, and contributor roles. It is not a starter kit. It is a cognitive reference space for developers, reviewers, and architects building within the Nexus framework.

## üéØ Purpose

This repo exists to:

- Document every rule, schema, and mechanic in the Nexus ecosystem.
- Provide teachable, reviewable artifacts for contributors and mentors.
- Host static, structured data (JSON, TSV, CSV) rendered via a lightweight Vite + TypeScript app.
- Serve as the canonical source of truth for alliance charters, Echo logic, plugin manifests, and duel outcomes.

---

## üß± Tech Stack

- **Vite** + **React** + **TypeScript**
- **TailwindCSS** for styling
- **D3** and **PapaParse** for charts and data parsing
- **Static data**: All logic is driven by structured files (`.json`, `.tsv`, `.csv`)

## üß† Philosophy

- **Barebone-first**: Workers start minimal, earn capabilities through contribution.
- **Echo-aware**: Every action is teachable, reviewable, and emotionally fair.
- **Alliance-driven**: Collaboration is incentivized through currency, reputation, and role evolution.
- **Mentor-respected**: Overrides and promotions are guided by trust and clarity.
